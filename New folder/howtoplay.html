        <h2>How to Play Chess</h2>
        <div>
            <b>Objective of Chess </b>
            The primary objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is in a
            position to be captured (in "check") and there is no legal move that can remove the king from attack.
            Essentially, the king is trapped and cannot escape capture.

            <b> Gameplay-></b>
            <b><u> The Chessboard and Pieces: </u></b>

            <li>The game is played on an 8x8 grid of 64 squares, alternating in color (light and dark). </li>
            <li>Each player begins with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.</li>
            <li>The pieces are set up in the same position at the start of every game.</li>

        </div>
        <div>
            <b><u>How Pieces Move</u></b>

            <li>King: Moves one square in any direction.</li>
            <li>Queen: Moves any number of squares in any direction.</li>
            <li>Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
            <li>Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
            <li>Knight: Moves in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
            <li>Pawn: Moves forward one square, with the option to move two squares forward on its first move. Captures
                diagonally.
            </li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b><u>Special Moves </u></b>
            <li> <u>Castling:</u> A move involving the king and a rook. The king moves two squares towards a rook, and
                the rook moves to the square next to the king. Conditions for castling: neither piece has moved, no
                pieces between them, and the king is not in check or moving through/into check.
            </li>
            <li><u>En Passant:</u> A special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward from its
                starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. The opponent's pawn can capture it as if it had
                only moved one square.
            </li>
            <li><u>Promotion:</u> When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it is promoted to any other piece
                (except a king), usually a queen.</li>

        </div>
        <div>
            <b><u> Turns</u></b>

            <li>Players take turns to move one piece at a time.</li>
            <li>A move consists of moving a piece to an empty square or capturing an opponent's piece.</li>
            <li>Players aim to control the board, protect their own pieces, and put the opponent's king in check.</li>
        </div>

            <b><u>Winning and Losing</u></b>
            <b>Check and Checkmate</b>
            <li> <b>Check:</b> When the king is under immediate threat of capture. The player must make a move to remove
                the king from check.
            </li>
            <li> <b>Checkmate:</b> When the king is in check and cannot escape. The game ends, and the player whose king
                is checkmated loses.</li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>Draws</b>

            <!-- The game can end in a draw under several conditions: -->

            <li><u>Stalemate:</u> The player to move has no legal move and their king is not in check.</li>
            <li><u>Threefold Repetition:</u> The same position occurs three times with the same player to move.</li>
            <li><u>Insufficient Material:</u> Neither player has enough pieces to checkmate the opponent.
            </li>
            <li><u>50-Move Rule:</u> If 50 moves are made by each player without any pawn movement or capture.</li>
