        <h2>How to Play Tic Tac Toe</h2>
        <div> 
            <b>1. Board Setup:</b> TicTacToe is played on a grid of 3x3 squares. Each player takes turns marking a square with their respective symbol. 
        </div>
        <div> 
            <b>2. Players:</b> There are two players in this game, Player X and Player O.
            Player X goes first and marks their squares with an "X" symbol. Player O goes next and marks their squares with an "O" symbol.     
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>3. Gameplay:</b> Players take turns marking an empty square on the grid with their symbol. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>4. Winning Conditions:</b> If a player successfully places three of their symbols in a row, they win the game. The game ends immediately when a player wins, and no further moves are required.
            If all the squares on the grid are filled, and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>5. Game Over:</b> The game is over when one player wins or when a draw occurs. To play again, simply restart the game or start a new round..
